**Research Question:** 

*Where will animals benefit the most from wildlife corridors in Pima County?*

*Procedures:* 

1. Brainstorm ideas  
2. Research A methods,map making methods,  wildlife coordinators, and wildlife in Tucson  
3. Mapping individual species like mammals, large reptiles and amphibians most populated areas to not as populated areas using AI and data from Inat and open street map. (BIg step with many little steps.)  
     
- Using codex, which is an AI model used for coding, and ChatGPT (a big AI model used for many things)  
-  INAT (iNaturalist)  a community citizen science site where people upload their own pictures of plants and animals project to identify and map living things.   
- Open Street maps a free, collaborative project to create a digital map of the world, built by a community of volunteers. 


4. Combining all of those maps together.  
5. Adding major roads/busy roads to the map.  
6. Assess the best places to put the wildlife corridors (a wildlife corridor, a strip of natural habitat connecting populations of wildlife otherwise separated by [cultivated](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=40b58b6893930f8b&q=cultivated&si=AMgyJEsoxf1x3izMIRdcfaP2O5eHR76Wrqq18btgoDz3KEneJFTTamdewd-aQTh7mQTcmIhVoAD6qzZ1HIsxvEaiRedrB2iySv8--PSTM6f8lTv9-vdz5QY%3D&expnd=1&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=2ahUKEwjAoIj9t8KQAxUSMEQIHVEUDnYQyecJegQIFhAQ) land, roads, etc.by using speed limits, culvert, places where animals can already cross, and using the map data.  
7. Share it with the community.

**AI as a Tool**  
On October 26 I used ChatGPT to practice making making maps. I also used it to help me narrow down my sources of information.
