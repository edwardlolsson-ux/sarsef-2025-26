(Source: [SARSEF - Ask Questions and Identify Problems](https://sarsef.org/sarsef-fair/create-a-project/preparation/ask-questions-and-identify-problems/))

## Purpose
Learn how to ask scientific or engineering questions and identify meaningful problems for your project.

## Key Points
- Explore the world around you and notice what makes you wonder. Ask questions based on observations or previous investigations.
- Background research is important: Use multiple reliable sources to understand your topic, build on others’ work, and identify what science concepts are important.
- Connect with mentors, teachers, and other experts for advice.

### Developing Your Main Research Question
A good project question/problem:
- Is interesting to you
- Is possible and affordable
- Has at least 3 reliable research sources available
- Can be tested with empirical evidence
- If engineering, has a clear problem and can identify criteria for a solution.

## Skills Developed
- Distinguishing observations from inferences
- Identifying errors, claims, evidence
- Reading scientific/technical texts
