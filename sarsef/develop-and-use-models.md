# SARSEF: Develop and Use Models

(Source: [SARSEF - Develop and Use Models](https://sarsef.org/sarsef-fair/create-a-project/preparation/develop-and-use-models/))

## What is a Model?
A model represents a system you want to understand. Models can be:
- Diagrams, flowcharts
- Simulations, computer models
- Mathematical equations
- Physical recreations or prototypes

Models help you:
- Focus on specific parts of your topic
- Make predictions
- Communicate ideas
- Collect or visualize data

### Adjusting Models
- Models aren’t perfect. Compare predictions with real-world observations and adjust them.
- In engineering, use models to test designs, analyze flaws, and make improvements.
