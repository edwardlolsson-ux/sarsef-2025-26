# SARSEF: Plan Investigations

(Source: [SARSEF - Plan Investigations](https://sarsef.org/sarsef-fair/create-a-project/preparation/plan-investigations/))

## Purpose
Learn how to set up science or engineering investigations for your project.

## Steps:
1. **State your investigation goal**
2. **Predict outcomes**
3. **Plan a course of action for collecting data**

Data can be quantitative (numbers) or qualitative (descriptions), but must be collected systematically for fair and reliable results.

### Variables
- **Independent variable:** What you change
- **Dependent variable:** What you measure
- **Control group:** Comparison group
- **Uncontrollable conditions:** Record and discuss as experiment 'limitations' (like weather)

### Safety and Rules
- Make sure investigations are safe
- Gather all materials and equipment first
- Stay within deadlines
- Get SRC approval for some types of projects (e.g., human/animal subjects)
- Get informed consent for human subjects
